# ALCHEMIA_beta
kernel written in rust based off windows kernel with security scanning

Explanation of Features:
Stack Overflow Protection:

The stack canary and shadow stack protection mechanisms detect stack overflow attacks. If a stack canary is altered, the kernel halts.
Malware Detection:

The kernel scans memory for known malware signatures at startup. If malware is detected, the system halts immediately.
Memory Management:

A simplified function simulates memory allocation. In a real-world scenario, this would involve more complex interactions with the memory management unit (MMU).
I/O Operations:

The kernel includes a basic function to simulate writing to an I/O port, which is typical in low-level system programming.
System Call Handling:

The system call handler controls processes, starting and terminating them based on the system call number.
Security Logging:

The mock println! macro simulates logging actions, which would typically involve writing to a console, serial port, or log file in a real kernel.
How to Use:
Compile the Kernel:

Compile the kernel using the Rust toolchain, ensuring you have bootimage installed.
Create an ISO:

Use grub-mkrescue or similar tools to create a bootable ISO from the compiled kernel.
Test in VirtualBox:

Set up a virtual machine in VirtualBox, attach the ISO, and boot from it to see the kernel in action.
Summary
This Rust kernel file is a combination of basic operating system functionalities and advanced security features, such as malware detection and stack overflow protection.
